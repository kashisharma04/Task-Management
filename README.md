# Task-Management

## Project overview
Create a RESTful API for managing tasks using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## Technologies
1. Node.js and Express.js for building the API.
2. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
3. MONGODB for data storage.

## Task
Create a MongoDB schema/model for tasks with fields such as title, description, status, and due date.

## API Endpoints:
1. Create API endpoints for the following operations:
2. Create a Task: POST /api/tasks
3. Read all Tasks: GET /api/tasks
4. Read a Task by ID: GET /api/tasks/:taskId
5. Update a Task by ID: PUT /api/tasks/:taskId
6. Delete a Task by ID: DELETE /api/tasks/:taskId

## Validation:
Implement basic validation for incoming data (e.g., required fields, data types).
Handle validation errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
Middleware:

Create middleware functions for common tasks (e.g., error handling, logging).
Testing:

Write tests for your API using a testing framework like Mocha, Chai, or Jest.
Test both successful and error scenarios for each API endpoint.
Documentation:

Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or write clear API documentation in your project's README.md file.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling for common errors (e.g., not found, server errors).
Security:

Implement basic security measures such as sanitizing input, preventing SQL injection, and using environment variables for sensitive data.
